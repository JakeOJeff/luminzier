A drawing app based on math and variables!

## Guide

- Create an Object by clicking on the '+' button on the left taskbar and select a shape.
- The variables of the shape will be visible when selected. You can click on it and edit them
- Type either a number or, be fun with it, do MATH.
- You have access to all the variables in the Software ( most of them atleast ), and some variables defined just for you.

## Variables 

Here are some variables you may use ( No math in colour! )

- (c) - { x, y, width, height } : Canvas Values
- (this) - { properties - { list of properties } } : Returns the property value of the current selected object
- ( More Coming Soon )

## How to use

### Number Properties

Type in a math Value or an expression, for example :
- `c.w/2 - this.properties.width/2` ( Centers the rectangle on the X axis )

Press 'Enter' to set the value.

### String Properties

There are two variables for String Values
 - fill : To make a filled shape
 - line : To make a outlined shape

Press 'Enter' to set the value.

### Color Properties

Type in a number between 0 - 1 and press 'space' to go the next box. After all three boxes are filled, press 'Enter' to set the value.

## Extra Notes [ IMPORTANT ]

- Changes in 'rx' or 'ry' may not be seen until both of them are edited as they work together.
- For Simple errors, it will be displayed on top of the textbox. If it seems critical or harmful to the software, it will show you a blue screen with the error message on it. This is a way of protecting the software since it is exposed to the user through the endpoint. You can just close it and restart it like normal.
